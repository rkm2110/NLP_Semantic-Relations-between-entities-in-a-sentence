# NLP_Semantic Relations between entities in a sentence
 Design and implementation of models for extracting semantic relations between two named entities in a sentence. There are two named entities “e1” and “e2” in a sentence. A relation and its direction that holds between the two entities is provided. We had to design an algorithm to learn from the training examples and classify the entities among the following relations: Entity-Destination, CauseEffect, Instrument-Agency, Content-Container, Component-Whole, Entity-Origin, Message-Topic, Product-Producer, Member-Collection, and Other.
